# CheshireTerminalMCP

To create a Minecraft Protocol (MCP) server and client to handle the Cheshire Trading Terminal's functionality, we’ll need to adapt the trading system into a Minecraft-compatible framework. This involves designing a simplified server-client architecture using the Minecraft protocol, where the server manages trading logic and data, and the client (via in-game commands or GUI) interacts with the trading terminal. Below is a conceptual implementation using Python with the `mcproto` library for the Minecraft protocol, assuming a basic setup for demonstration purposes. This will be a simplified proof-of-concept—real-world implementation would require more robust networking, security, and integration with the Solana blockchain and Jupiter DEX.

---

### Overview
- **Server**: Runs the Cheshire Trading Terminal logic, processes trading data, and communicates with clients using Minecraft packets.
- **Client**: A Minecraft client (or mod) that sends commands (e.g., via chat) and receives trading data as chat messages or custom UI elements.
- **Protocol**: Uses Minecraft’s client-server protocol (1.20.x as an example) to exchange data.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Libraries: `mcproto` (for Minecraft protocol), `asyncio` (for async networking), `requests` (for mock API calls).
- Basic Minecraft server knowledge.

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install mcproto asyncio requests
```

### MCP Server Implementation

The server will handle trading logic, simulate the Cheshire AI Collective, and respond to client commands.

```python
import asyncio
from mcproto import protocol
from mcproto.packets import Packet, ChatMessagePacket
from mcproto.server import MinecraftServer
import json
import random

# Simulated Cheshire Trading Terminal data
class CheshireTerminal:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prices = {"SOL": 150.0, "ETH": 3000.0}
        self.portfolio = {"SOL": 10, "ETH": 2}
        self.alerts = []

    def get_price(self, token):
        # Simulate price fluctuation
        self.prices[token] *= random.uniform(0.98, 1.02)
        return round(self.prices[token], 2)

    def get_portfolio(self):
        return self.portfolio

    def trade(self, token, amount, action):
        if action == "buy":
            self.portfolio[token] = self.portfolio.get(token, 0) + amount
        elif action == "sell" and self.portfolio.get(token, 0) >= amount:
            self.portfolio[token] -= amount
        return f"Trade executed: {action} {amount} {token}"

    def add_alert(self, message):
        self.alerts.append(message)

# Minecraft Server
class CheshireServer(MinecraftServer):
    def __init__(self, host="0.0.0.0", port=25565):
        super().__init__(host, port)
        self.terminal = CheshireTerminal()
        self.connected_players = {}

    async def handle_packet(self, packet: Packet, sender):
        if isinstance(packet, ChatMessagePacket):
            message = packet.message.strip()
            player_id = sender.uuid
            response = await self.process_command(message, player_id)
            await self.send_chat(sender, response)

    async def process_command(self, message, player_id):
        """Process Cheshire Trading Terminal commands."""
        if message.startswith("/price"):
            token = message.split(" ")[1] if len(message.split()) > 1 else "SOL"
            price = self.terminal.get_price(token)
            return f"Current {token} price: ${price}"
        
        elif message.startswith("/portfolio"):
            portfolio = self.terminal.get_portfolio()
            return f"Your portfolio: {json.dumps(portfolio)}"
        
        elif message.startswith("/trade"):
            try:
                _, action, token, amount = message.split(" ")
                amount = float(amount)
                result = self.terminal.trade(token, amount, action)
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                return f"Error: {str(e)}"
        
        elif message.startswith("/alerts"):
            alerts = self.terminal.alerts if self.terminal.alerts else ["No alerts."]
            return "\n".join(alerts)
        
        return "Unknown command. Try: /price, /portfolio, /trade, /alerts"

    async def send_chat(self, player, message):
        """Send a chat message to the player."""
        chat_packet = ChatMessagePacket(message=message, position=1)  # 1 = Chat
        await player.connection.write_packet(chat_packet)

    async def on_player_join(self, player):
        self.connected_players[player.uuid] = player
        await self.send_chat(player, "Welcome to Cheshire Trading Terminal!")
        self.terminal.add_alert(f"Player {player.username} joined the market.")

    async def on_player_leave(self, player):
        del self.connected_players[player.uuid]
        self.terminal.add_alert(f"Player {player.username} left the market.")

# Run the server
async def main():
    server = CheshireServer()
    print("Starting Cheshire Trading Server...")
    await server.start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### MCP Client Implementation

The client will connect to the server and allow players to interact with the trading terminal via chat commands. For simplicity, this is a basic script—real clients would typically be Minecraft mods (e.g., Forge/Fabric).

```python
import asyncio
from mcproto import protocol
from mcproto.client import MinecraftClient
from mcproto.packets import ChatMessagePacket, JoinGamePacket

class CheshireClient(MinecraftClient):
    def __init__(self, host="localhost", port=25565, username="Trader"):
        super().__init__(host, port, username)

    async def handle_packet(self, packet: Packet):
        if isinstance(packet, JoinGamePacket):
            print(f"Joined server as {self.username}")
        elif isinstance(packet, ChatMessagePacket):
            print(f"[Server] {packet.message}")

    async def send_command(self, command):
        """Send a command to the server."""
        chat_packet = ChatMessagePacket(message=command)
        await self.connection.write_packet(chat_packet)

async def main():
    client = CheshireClient()
    print(f"Connecting to Cheshire Trading Server as {client.username}...")
    await client.connect()

    # Example interaction
    commands = [
        "/price SOL",
        "/portfolio",
        "/trade buy SOL 5",
        "/alerts"
    ]
    
    for cmd in commands:
        await client.send_command(cmd)
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Wait for response

    # Keep the client running
    await asyncio.Future()  # Run indefinitely

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### How It Works

1. **Server Setup**:
   - The `CheshireServer` class extends `MinecraftServer` to handle Minecraft protocol packets.
   - It simulates the Cheshire Trading Terminal with basic price tracking, portfolio management, and trading logic.
   - Commands like `/price`, `/portfolio`, `/trade`, and `/alerts` are processed and responded to via chat messages.

2. **Client Setup**:
   - The `CheshireClient` connects to the server, authenticates as a player, and sends commands.
   - Responses from the server are displayed in the console (in a real mod, this would be in-game chat or a custom GUI).

3. **Example Interaction**:
   - Player runs `/price SOL` → Server responds: "Current SOL price: $150.25".
   - Player runs `/trade buy SOL 5` → Server responds: "Trade executed: buy 5 SOL".
   - Alerts are generated when players join/leave, simulating market events.

### Extending to Full Functionality

To fully integrate the Cheshire Trading Terminal:

1. **HAAS Integration**:
   - Replace the simple `CheshireTerminal` class with a multi-agent system (e.g., using threads or asyncio tasks for Market Analysis, Risk Management, and Execution Optimization agents).
   - Fetch real-time data from Jupiter DEX via API calls.

2. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Use Minecraft’s custom GUI packets (e.g., `OpenWindowPacket`) to create an in-game dashboard with charts and metrics.
   - Render price charts as ASCII art in chat or via resource packs.

3. **Security**:
   - Implement MEV protection logic by analyzing mock mempool data.
   - Add authentication to secure player wallets and trades.

4. **Social Sentiment**:
   - Integrate X API calls (using my analysis tools) to fetch sentiment data and display it in-game.

5. **Scalability**:
   - Use a database (e.g., SQLite) to store player portfolios and market data persistently.
   - Support multiple players with concurrent connections.

### Running the Demo

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
2. In a separate terminal, start the client:
   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

You’ll see the client connect and execute commands, with responses printed to the console.

---

### Notes
- This is a basic implementation to demonstrate the concept. A production-ready MCP server would need proper error handling, security (e.g., encryption), and integration with Solana/Jupiter DEX APIs.
- For a real Minecraft mod, you’d use Forge/Fabric with Java or a Python-to-Java bridge, but this Python version showcases the logic.
- The current date (March 06, 2025) isn’t explicitly used but could be added for timestamped trades/alerts.

Let me know if you’d like to expand any specific part (e.g., HAAS agents, GUI, or blockchain integration)!
